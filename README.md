# Automation Test Suite

## Overview

This repository contains an automation test suite for panco app. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the functionality of the application is working as expected by automating the process of running various tests. This will help catch bugs earlier and speed up the testing process.

## Features

- **Automated Tests**: The test suite automates the process of testing .
- **Test Reports**: Detailed reports on test results, highlighting passed and failed tests.
- **Cross-Browser Testing** (optional, if applicable): Supports running tests on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- **Continuous Integration Support** (optional, if applicable): Integrates with CI tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this automation test suite, follow the steps below:
``

2. **Install dependencies**:


   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - For Python:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   (Make sure to update this section based on your project's specific dependencies.)

3. **Configure the environment** (optional): If your tests require environment variables or specific configurations (like browser settings, API keys, etc.), ensure they are properly set up.

### Running the Tests

To run the automation tests, simply execute the following command:

- For Node.js:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- For Python:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover
  ```

(Adjust this based on the test framework you are using.)

### Test Reports

After the tests complete, you can find the results in the app. This could be a console log, HTML report, or a service like Allure Reports, depending on your setup.
